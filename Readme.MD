SpacyMote!
==========

The production server for this project is at spacymote.space. This server should
contain the most up to date and hopefully stable version.

TODO: since this project is a little small for issue tracking, the status of the project will b documented here.
1. fix the emoji story wrapping
2. enable the export button
3. replace the clear and export buttons with images or imojis that look like that would mean clear/export
I think at this point we can consider this project to be feature complete. If we decide to add stuff we can all it V2.
